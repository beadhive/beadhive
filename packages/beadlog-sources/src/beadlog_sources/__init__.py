"""BeadHive-free BeadLog producers (``docs/design/backfill-platform-adr.md`` section 2).

A **library** package: it depends only on ``beadlog`` (through its public ``__all__``) and
never imports ``beadhive``. It owns:

- the contracts (:mod:`beadlog_sources.contracts`): source strategies (entry-point group
  ``beadlog.sources``) and the judgment port shaped like Jev's Choice/Score primitives;
- the judgment engines (:mod:`beadlog_sources.judges`): the deterministic lexical judge, the
  ``bh-judge/1`` command judge that fails closed, and :class:`JudgeSettings` (the
  ``backfill.judge`` keys);
- the neutral ``bd`` baseline strategy (:mod:`beadlog_sources.bd`): one ``bd export`` read as
  current-state events, re-emitting the BeadLog ids a bd loader stored in ``metadata.bdlg``;
- reconcile against a baseline (:mod:`beadlog_sources.reconcile`): NEW / PRESENT / NOISE /
  DRIFT plans written as ``.bdlg`` archives;
- the standalone ``beadlog`` CLI (:mod:`beadlog_sources.cli`) and the opt-in reference judge
  command ``bh-judge-haiku`` (:mod:`beadlog_sources.haiku`, ``[haiku]`` extra).
